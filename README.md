## The game

- Increase/change the size of the gameboard.
- Instead of completely stopping the game when it's over, allow the player to start a new game.
- Add a sound track and sound effects to the game.
- Add the possibility of having lives.
- Increase the difficulty level of the game as time passes by making the enemies go faster.
- Allow the player to shoot bullets at the enemies.
- Add another type of entity called `Bonus` that will also fall from the sky and add points to the score.
- Make the game more hardcore by allowing the player to also move up/down.
